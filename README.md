# CodeAuTr-sor

The project name translates to "TreasureCode" as in "treasure map".

It's a project I made for my girlfriend.

The intention was to allow her to learn how to write elementary code, with classes and functions, while guiding her with hints.

To play the game, you mut NOT look into the first project, and only look into the "solution" one where you will write the demands received from the program when launching the "CodeAuTrésor" executable.

Have fun!
